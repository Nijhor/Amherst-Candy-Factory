# Amherst-Candy-Factory
Project done in Operating System course

<p>Amherst  candy  factory  is  preparing  up  for  Halloween  and  has  implemented  an 
assembly  line  to  ramp  up  Halloween  candy  production.  The  assembly  line  will  be 
implemented  using  a  bounded  buffer  producer  and  consumers.  The  factory  contains 
two  types  of  worker  threads:  producers  and  consumers.  Each  producer  thread 
produces  a  certain  type  of  candy,  while  each  consumer  creates  boxes  of  assorted 
candies  using  ones  produced  by  producers.  After  producing  each  candy,  the 
producer  deposits  into  the  bounded  buffer.  If  the  buffer  is  full,  it  must  wait  until 
one slot  becomes  available.
